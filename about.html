<h2>About</h2>

<p id="intro">We hope you can spare a few minutes of your time and help us by answering the questions in the following survey. We realize that some of the questions are silly and some may seem too personal, but appreciate your willingness to participate. Your answers will remain anonymous. We look forward to sharing with you the visual outcome of our project.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for you time,
<br>
Kayla Lewis and Gabriela Lemos</p>
