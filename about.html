<h2>About</h2>

<p id="intro">We hope you can help contribute to our project by answering the questions in the following survey. We realize that some of the questions are silly and some may seem too personal, but appreciate your willingness to participate. Any output from the survey will keep your answers anonymous. We look forward to sharing the visual outcome, and we will keep you posted with updates.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time,
<br>
Kayla Lewis and Gabriela Lemos</p>
